      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p><strong>ALT SCHOOL ID: ALT-SOE/025/2016</strong></p>
      <p>
        My name is Elton Ramos, and I was born in Cape Verde. I am an experienced English teacher with nearly seven years in the field. Over the years, I have developed strong skills in interpreting, transcribing, and translating official documents. I have provided both simultaneous and consecutive interpreting services, as well as written translations, in English, Portuguese, and Cape Verdean for a range of clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in informatics began during my school years, when I started by repairing computers. That early curiosity grew into a passion for experimenting with HTML, Python, and other programming languages. I was driven by a desire to bring my ideas to life and use technology to transform education. This motivation eventually led me to pursue a deeper understanding of front-end development, which is why I enrolled in ALT School's Front End Engineering program.

      <p>
        I joined the Front End Engineering program at ALT School to gain the skills needed to design and develop applications that are both interactive and impactful. As a teacher, I often felt limited in bringing to life the dynamic, engaging learning experiences I envisioned for my students. This program provides a structured path, guided by experienced developers and supported by a collaborative community of learners—an environment where I can grow and thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALT School’s focus on practical, real-world skills makes it an ideal place for me to deepen my knowledge of modern technologies like React and to build responsive, user-friendly interfaces that can transform how people experience education.
